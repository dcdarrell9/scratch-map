Definitions
===========

Below are a list of definitions used within the project.


Definition of Ready
###################

This definition of ready should be taken with a pinch of salt. It's not a set list of requirements, it's about things to consider whether an issue/card can be worked on with minimal 'admin' effort and focus can be solely on the research/development.

- **Issue raised in Github**
- **Clear instructions of what is required from the issue / outcomes**
- **What are the wants and needs of the issue, is it valuable?**
- **Acceptance criteria set correctly**
- **Independent of other issues (when applicable)**
- **No estimations needed, issues should small enough / split into independent cards**
- **Steps to work through?**


Definition of Done
##################

This definition of done can be considered a guideline to what we 'should' have completed by actioning on a ticket.

- **Code has been tested**
- **Bug/Feature is tested/reviewed against acceptance criteria**
- **Bug/Feature passes all tests and passes ci/cd analysis tools**
- **Code is review ready**
- **Bug/Feature is documented (Handover/Knowledge share included)**
