# Definition of Done

This definition of done can be considered a guideline to what we 'should' have completed by actioning on a ticket.

- **Code has been tested**
- **Bug/Feature is tested/reviewed against acceptance criteria**
- **Bug/Feature passes all tests and passes ci/cd analysis tools**
- **Code is review ready**
- **Bug/Feature is documented (Handover/Knowledge share included)**
