## Definition of Done

This definition of done can be considered a guideline to what we 'should' have completed by actioning on a ticket.

- # Code has been tested locally
- # Bug/Feature is tested against acceptance criteria
- # Bug/Feature passes all tests
- # Code is review ready
- # Bug/Feature is documented (Handover/Knowledge share included)
