## Definition of Ready

This definition of ready should be taken with a pinch of salt. It's not a set list of requirements, it's about things to consider whether an issue/card can be worked on with minimal 'admin' effort and focus can be solely on the research/development.

- # Issue raised in Github
- # Clear instructions of what is required from the issue / outcomes
- # What are the wants and needs of the issue, is it valuable?
- # Acceptance criteria set correctly
- # Independent of other issues (when applicable)
- # No estimations needed, issues should small enough / split into independent cards
- # Steps to work through?
